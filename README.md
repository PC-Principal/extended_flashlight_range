`<Reference Include="Assembly-CSharp" HintPath="E:\Games\Steam\steamapps\common\Lethal Company\Lethal Company_Data\Managed\Assembly-CSharp.dll" Publicize="true" />`

Here you need to change HintPath to your's file source with Assembly-CSharp.dll

The same things you need to do witch all strings, that seems like `E:\Games\Steam\...`
